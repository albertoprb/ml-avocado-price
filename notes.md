# EDA TODO:
* Plot different types of avocado prices (PLC and Bagged)
* Time series clean
    * Investigate Dec 2018
    * Investigate duplicate dates
* Plot seasonality
    * Plot the price vs volume
    * Plot the price vs avocado season
* Correlation table
* Investigate duplicate days (Hypothesis)
* Create a data dictionary

# ML TODO:

### Planned
* Remove unnecessary columns
    * Total volume, Total bags
* Prepare the date column
    * Year, Week
* Scale of numeric data (all columns)
* 3 weeks of data missing in Dec 2018 --> Would it affect the ML algorithm
* sklearn imputer for number headers (e.g. 4046)

### Needs analysis
* Time series split 
* Organic vs conventional split
* Slice by Region level? Total US vs. Regions vs. Cities

### Maybes

* PCA for dimension reduction
